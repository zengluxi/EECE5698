Reading assignment:  (Mapping projections)
* First of all, I think that I actually learned a lot of new knowledge from this article, for example: the idea of map projection is fresh new to me. 
* Before that, from geographic point, I only knew about latitude, longitude and altitude. 
* The way author describes about the map projection is vivid and not that hard to imagine, as he said there are three major ways: cylinder, cone and plane. 
* And you could imagine them as putting the whole earth into three containers, and you will get the projection of meridians and parallels. 
* For the map projection, the author also mentioned about the tradeoff, which is a generally used concept in engineering field: you will get something with the expense of losing something else. 
* Like in the map projection, you may could have the correct scale but the shape is somehow distorted, or vice versa. 
* The idea of longitude and altitude  reminds me of high school’s geography classes, which I usually confused about which one is which. 
* I think it’s crucial to mention at the beginning that the rule that is going to apply throughout the book: positive east longitude and north latitude, and negative west longitude and south latitude.

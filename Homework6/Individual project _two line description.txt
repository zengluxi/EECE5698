For the individual project, I would like to build a robot that can help people do the house cleaning, this idea is inspired by 'iRobot's products. In this robot, it will be mainly equipped with indoor GPS sensor to navigate the robot, and it could bounce back when hitting the corner, and also audio sensor, battery, etc. For the power, I will just use the standard power supply:120Vac with a frequency of 60 Hz.

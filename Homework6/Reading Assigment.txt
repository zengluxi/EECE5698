Article 1: No, Robots Aren’t Killing the American Dream
1. In this article, the author are claiming the point that developing the industry of robot will not make the job unemployment more serious,  especially in the middle class, as a lot of people are worried about the robot will take over their job in the future. 
As opposite, the author thought that those politicians should be the ones that people blame about, 
as they failed to support/develop policies that let workers share the wealth from technology-led growth. 
2. From my personal perspective, I would take the article as New York Times's editorial board, 
trying to put some pressure on the new government, 
appealed to introduce fair taxation of corporations and the wealthy ensured the public a fair share of profits from companies 
enriched by government investments in science and technology.
3. In my opinion, another more important factor that led to people’s fear about the development of robotics is coming from those science fiction movies about robots. 
As depicted in those movies,  robots can do almost everything for people, from daily housework to the high-tech computation,  from performing the required task to make the decision on their own. 
It looks perfectly fine under the normal situation, but once things are in chaos, the issue that robot can think on their is become extremely dangerous, which may even lead to a war between robot and people. 
4. But even we knew that there can be some crisis in the future with the robot’s mind thinking 
(may be even for now,  as the machine learning allows the robot to find the material online and learn by themselves), 
it doesn’t mean that we should halt the development of robot. 
Without any doubt, developing the robot industry will greatly stimulate the nourishment of country and worldwide economic development.
